<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>What do you do to further publicize a club?</p>
<p>I am thrilled to announce, on behalf of the Carleton Cybersecurity Club, that as a part of our continued improvements we have launched this brand new website.</p>
<p>Sponsored by <strong><a href="https://fortified.host/">Fortified Host</a></strong>, who is graciously providing webhosting for our club free of charge. If you'd like to purchase your own webhosting from them, you can use code <code>cucybersec2024</code> for 50% off, forever!</p>
<p><strong>New Website, Who Dis?</strong></p>
<p>This new website (as you reading are no doubt aware) doubles as a blog for the club. While serving the purpose of directing people to the Discord, it also allows for us to release writings, disclosure releases, and our members' take on current Cybersecurity News.</p>
<p>We're proud to announce our first post is already online, based on the story of a member's recent accidental finding a set of leaked emails and passwords in the wild:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/data-leak">The SAR Approach: Responding to Data Leaks with Integrity</a></p>
<p><strong>How Can You Contribute?</strong></p>
<p>Want to show off your knowledge? Want to inform others about your niche of cybersecurity? Want to explain a recent cyber attack that the news is failing to accurately describe?</p>
<p>We're accepting proposals/drafts for blog posts, submit yours here: <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/98zyp2GrJM">https://forms.office.com/r/98zyp2GrJM</a></p>
<p>Whatever you want to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips and best practices for staying secure online</li>
<li>Tutorials on hacking tools</li>
<li>Interviews with industry experts</li>
<li>Technical information about recent hacks</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to share your submissions.</p>
