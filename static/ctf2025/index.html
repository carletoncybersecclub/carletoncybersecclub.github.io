                <p><strong>Carleton School of Computer Science</strong><br>
The Carleton University School of Computer Science, established in 1980, quickly became a leader in computer science education and research in Canada. Initially offering a Bachelor of Computer Science with five specialization streams, the School rapidly expanded its facilities and programs, embracing the microcomputer revolution and introducing co-operative education by 1988. It pioneered object-oriented programming education, with faculty and alumni playing key roles in the development of Smalltalk, Java tools, and the Eclipse platform.                 </p>
