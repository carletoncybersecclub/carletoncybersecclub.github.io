<!-- title: Workshop: Web Exploitation Basics -->
<!-- author: Club Executive -->

Hey Member, as promised, we're holding another workshop this Thursday! 

This time we'll be going over the basics of **web exploitation**. (Don't forget that attendance grants you points in the Leaderboard as we prepare for CyberSci and CTF's!)

Join us on the **18th of September at 6pm in HP 5345.**

***P.S.*** make sure you come with a computer that has Kali Linux installed (which can be through virtual machine). Here is a guide you can follow to install it on VirtualBox: [https://linuxsimply.com/linux-basics/os-installation/virtual-machine/kali-linux-on-virtualbox/](https://linuxsimply.com/linux-basics/os-installation/virtual-machine/kali-linux-on-virtualbox/)

See you there!
